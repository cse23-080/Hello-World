    <p>www, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected web pages that allows users to access information and communicate with others online. It has revolutionized the way we interact with the world, making it easier to find and share information with just a few clicks of a button. The endless possibilities of the World Wide Web have made it an essential part of modern life.</p>
    <p>HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of content on a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML is essential for web development and is often used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive websites. Learning HTML is a great starting point for anyone interested in web design and development.</p>
    <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements. By separating the presentation from the content of a web page, CSS allows for greater control over the appearance of websites and makes them more flexible, accessible, and easier to maintain. CSS is an essential tool for web designers and developers, helping to create visually appealing websites that engage users and enhance the user experience.None</p>
